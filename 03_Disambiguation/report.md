The average score with nothing changed was 96.52

If we add rules that take take into account 1-3 character prefixes and suffixes of the current word the average increases to an average 96.85


If on top of that we take acount the same thing of the previous word average goes down to 96.75. Less good than if we had only changed the current word but still better than nothing.


if instead of taking into account the current and previous word parts, we take into account the current and future average becomes 96.81. better than nothing changed or both current and past.


Previous and next word give 96.82 nothing super drastic from what we've already seen. 

any other additions or combinations i could think of resulted in scores closer to nothing being changed, averaging 96.52


if we just delete rules the scores only get worse, no suprise there. Removing any rules that are just words gives us 95.62. Removing anything that didn't take into account tags gave us 88.90. using only words give us 89.00.

Generally the only drastic rule changes I could think of either drastically made the scores worse or minutley improved them, and none of the changes took the score above 96.85.
